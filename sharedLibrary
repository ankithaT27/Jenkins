create a var folder in your git repo and create a grrovy file may be called helloWorld.groovy and define your shared lib there
def helloworld(){
sh "hello to you"

Go to Jenkins-- configure system--> global pipeline linraries
go to pipeline-->add @Library("mysharedlibrary")

use the filename as a function wherever needed
eg: stage(build){
helloworld()
}
this will print hello to you
