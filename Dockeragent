master-slave appeoach is not always good as a lot of resources are wasted. 
we can configure autoscaling group but there is a good approach here, so use docker as agents, so run the pipeline on a docker container
So usage od agents reduces operational overhead and costs
(usermod -aG docker jenkins)
Install docker pipeline plugin on jenkins
